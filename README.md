## Modelling-victim-reporting-behaviour
====================================

# Purpose

The purpose of this research is to investigate the impact of police accessibility, visibility and police effectiveness on reporting behaviour. The determinants of police reporting have been widely researched in the past two decades, but research pertaining to developing countries is lacking. To date no research have been conducted to investigate the influence of 
police accessibility and visibility on the choice of the victim to either report or not report a crime to the police in 
a developing nation. The research will also investigate the influence of reporting to other entities on reporting to the police. 

# Methods

The research study presented in this paper makes use of separate logistic regression models applied to different crime types in order to investigate this phenomenon. Additional exploratory data analysis is conducted to further enhance our understanding of the impact accessibility, visibility and police effectiveness may have on reporting behaviour.
